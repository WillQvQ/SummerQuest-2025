      "abstract": "Policy search methods can allow robots to learn control policies for a wide\nrange of tasks, but practical applications of policy search often require\nhand-engineered components for perception, state estimation, and low-level\ncontrol. In this paper, we aim to answer the following question: does training\nthe perception and control systems jointly end-to-end provide better\nperformance than training each component separately? To this end, we develop a\nmethod that can be used to learn policies that map raw image observations\ndirectly to torques at the robot's motors. The policies are represented by deep\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) with 92,000 parameters, and are trained\nusing a partially observed guided policy search method, which transforms policy\nsearch into supervised learning, with supervision provided by a simple\ntrajectory-centric reinforcement learning method. We evaluate our method on a\nrange of real-world manipulation tasks that require close coordination between\nvision and control, such as screwing a cap onto a bottle, and present simulated\ncomparisons to a range of prior policy search methods.",

        "abstract": "Recently, robust reinforcement learning (RL) methods designed to handle adversarial input observations have received significant attention, motivated by RL's inherent vulnerabilities. While existing approaches have demonstrated reasonable success, addressing worst-case scenarios over long time horizons requires both minimizing the agent's cumulative rewards for adversaries and training agents to counteract them through alternating learning. However, this process introduces mutual dependencies between the agent and the adversary, making interactions with the environment inefficient and hindering the development of off-policy methods. In this work, we propose a novel off-policy method that eliminates the need for additional environmental interactions by reformulating adversarial learning as a soft-constrained optimization problem. Our approach is theoretically supported by the symmetric property of policy evaluation between the agent and the adversary. The implementation is available at https://github.com/nakanakakosuke/VALT_SAC.",

        "abstract": "Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.",

        "title": "What Matters in Learning from Large-Scale Datasets for Robot Manipulation",
        "abstract": "Imitation learning from large multi-task demonstration datasets has emerged as a promising path for building generally-capable robots. As a result, 1000s of hours have been spent on building such large-scale datasets around the globe. Despite the continuous growth of such efforts, we still lack a systematic understanding of what data should be collected to improve the utility of a robotics dataset and facilitate downstream policy learning. In this work, we conduct a large-scale dataset composition study to answer this question. We develop a data generation framework to procedurally emulate common sources of diversity in existing datasets (such as sensor placements and object types and arrangements), and use it to generate large-scale robot datasets with controlled compositions, enabling a suite of dataset composition studies that would be prohibitively expensive in the real world. We focus on two practical settings: (1) what types of diversity should be emphasized when future researchers collect large-scale datasets for robotics, and (2) how should current practitioners retrieve relevant demonstrations from existing datasets to maximize downstream policy performance on tasks of interest. Our study yields several critical insights -- for example, we find that camera poses and spatial arrangements are crucial dimensions for both diversity in collection and alignment in retrieval. In real-world robot learning settings, we find that not only do our insights from simulation carry over, but our retrieval strategies on existing datasets such as DROID allow us to consistently outperform existing training strategies by up to 70%.

        "abstract": "Data-driven approaches struggle with precise manipulation; imitation learning requires many hard-to-obtain demonstrations, while reinforcement learning yields brittle, non-generalizable policies. We introduce VisuoTactile Local (ViTaL) policy learning, a framework that solves fine-grained manipulation tasks by decomposing them into two phases: a reaching phase, where a vision-language model (VLM) enables scene-level reasoning to localize the object of interest, and a local interaction phase, where a reusable, scene-agnostic ViTaL policy performs contact-rich manipulation using egocentric vision and tactile sensing. This approach is motivated by the observation that while scene context varies, the low-level interaction remains consistent across task instances. By training local policies once in a canonical setting, they can generalize via a localize-then-execute strategy. ViTaL achieves around 90% success on contact-rich tasks in unseen environments and is robust to distractors. ViTaL's effectiveness stems from three key insights: (1) foundation models for segmentation enable training robust visual encoders via behavior cloning; (2) these encoders improve the generalizability of policies learned using residual RL; and (3) tactile sensing significantly boosts performance in contact-rich tasks. Ablation studies validate each of these insights, and we demonstrate that ViTaL integrates well with high-level VLMs, enabling robust, reusable low-level skills.

        "abstract": "Visuomotor policies often suffer from perceptual challenges, where visual differences between training and evaluation environments degrade policy performance. Policies relying on state estimations, like 6D pose, require task-specific tracking and are difficult to scale, while raw sensor-based policies may lack robustness to small visual disturbances.In this work, we leverage 2D keypoints - spatially consistent features in the image frame - as a flexible state representation for robust policy learning and apply it to both sim-to-real transfer and real-world imitation learning. However, the choice of which keypoints to use can vary across objects and tasks. We propose a novel method, ATK, to automatically select keypoints in a task-driven manner so that the chosen keypoints are predictive of optimal behavior for the given task. Our proposal optimizes for a minimal set of keypoints that focus on task-relevant parts while preserving policy performance and robustness. We distill expert data (either from an expert policy in simulation or a human expert) into a policy that operates on RGB images while tracking the selected keypoints. By leveraging pre-trained visual modules, our system effectively encodes states and transfers policies to the real-world evaluation scenario despite wide scene variations and perceptual challenges such as transparent objects, fine-grained tasks, and deformable objects manipulation. We validate ATK on various robotic tasks, demonstrating that these minimal keypoint representations significantly improve robustness to visual disturbances and environmental variations.

        "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) heavily relies on the coverage of pre-collected data over the target policy's distribution. Existing studies aim to improve data-policy coverage to mitigate distributional shifts, but overlook security risks from insufficient coverage, and the single-step analysis is not consistent with the multi-step decision-making nature of offline RL. To address this, we introduce the sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify coverage, and reveal its exponential amplification on the upper bound of estimation errors through theoretical analysis. Building on this, we propose the Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) poisoning attack. Considering the continuous nature of offline RL data, we convert state-action pairs into decision units, and extract representative decision patterns that capture multi-step behavior. We identify rare patterns likely to cause insufficient coverage, and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate distributional shifts. Experiments show that poisoning just 1% of the dataset can degrade agent performance by 90%. This finding provides new perspectives for analyzing and safeguarding the security of offline RL.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes the runtime learning machine for safety-critical learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS). The learning machine has three interactive components: a high-performance (HP)-Student, a high-assurance (HA)-Teacher, and a Coordinator. The HP-Student is a high-performance but not fully verified Phy-DRL (physics-regulated deep reinforcement learning) agent that performs runtime learning in real CPS, using real-time sensor data from real-time physical environments. On the other hand, HA-Teacher is a verified but simplified design, focusing on safety-critical functions only. As a complementary, HA-Teacher's novelty lies in real-time patch for two missions: i) correcting unsafe learning of HP-Student, and ii) backing up safety. The Coordinator manages the interaction between HP-Student and HA-Teacher. Powered by the three interactive components, the runtime learning machine notably features i) assuring lifetime safety (i.e., safety guarantee in any runtime learning stage), ii) tolerating unknown unknowns, iii) addressing Sim2Real gap, and iv) automatic hierarchy learning (i.e., safety-first learning, and then high-performance learning). Experiments involving a cart-pole system and two quadruped robots, as well as comparisons with state-of-the-art safe DRL, fault-tolerant DRL, and approaches for addressing Sim2Real gap, demonstrate the learning machine's effectiveness and unique features.",

By utilizing contextual information about the properties of individual robots and exploiting their modular structure in the architecture of deep reinforcement learning agents, steps have been made towards multi-robot control. Generalization to new, unseen robots, however, remains a challenge. In this paper we hypothesize that the relevant contextual information is partially observable, but that it can be inferred through interactions for better generalization to contexts that are not seen during training. To this extent, we implement a modular recurrent architecture and evaluate its generalization performance on a large set of MuJoCo robots. The results show a substantial improved performance on robots with unseen dynamics, kinematics, and topologies, in four different environments.",

Unlike conventional approaches that focus solely on control, we demonstrate that the desired trajectory significantly influences endpoint vibrations. To address this, a DRL motion planner, trained using the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, generates optimized trajectories that inherently minimize vibrations. The PDE nonlinear controller then computes the required torques to track the planned trajectory while ensuring closed-loop stability using Lyapunov analysis. The proposed methodology is validated through both simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating superior vibration suppression and tracking accuracy compared to traditional methods. The results underscore the potential of combining learning-based motion planning with model-based control for enhancing the precision and stability of flexible robotic manipulators.",

These types of variation are common in transfer learning but often overlooked by standard robust RL methods, which typically focus on small, uncorrelated changes. We provide a comprehensive characterization of these robustness properties, including formal guarantees under reward and transition uncertainty, as well as settings where the method performs poorly. Much of our analysis contrasts state entropy with the widely used policy entropy regularization, highlighting their different benefits. Finally, from a practical standpoint, we illustrate that compared with policy entropy, the robustness advantages of state entropy are more sensitive to the number of rollouts used for policy evaluation.",

This can be achieved by finding diverse policies that are optimal for some objective preferences and non-dominated by optimal policies for other preferences so that they form a Pareto front in the multi-objective performance space. The relation between the multi-objective performance space and the parameter space that represents the policies is generally non-unique. Using a training scheme that is based on a locally linear map between the parameter space and the performance space, we show that an approximate Pareto front can provide an interpretation of the current parameter vectors in terms of the objectives which enables an effective search within contiguous solution domains. Experiments are conducted with and without retraining across different domains, and the comparison with previous methods demonstrates the efficiency of our approach.",

Points within the same skill code are forced to be either pushed apart or pulled closer together depending on gradient directions. Further, to capture the causal relationship between skills, we present causal skill transformer (CST) which explicitly models dependencies between skill representations through an autoregressive mechanism for coherent action generation.

        "abstract": "The emergence of vision-language-action models (VLAs) for end-to-end control is reshaping the field of robotics by enabling the fusion of multimodal sensory inputs at the billion-parameter scale. The capabilities of VLAs stem primarily from their architectures, which are often based on frontier large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs are known to be susceptible to adversarial misuse, and given the significant physical risks inherent to robotics, questions remain regarding the extent to which VLAs inherit these vulnerabilities. Motivated by these concerns, in this work we initiate the study of adversarial attacks on VLA-controlled robots. Our main algorithmic contribution is the adaptation and application of LLM jailbreaking attacks to obtain complete control authority over VLAs. We find that textual attacks, which are applied once at the beginning of a rollout, facilitate full reachability of the action space of commonly used VLAs and often persist over longer horizons. This differs significantly from LLM jailbreaking literature, as attacks in the real world do not have to be semantically linked to notions of harm.

        "abstract": "In the domain of robot learning, equipping robots with the capability to swiftly acquire operational skills poses a significant challenge. Currently, reinforcement learning techniques are adept at addressing dynamic, unstructured problems involving rich contact scenarios. However, the convergence rate of these algorithms is often slow due to the high dimensionality of the robot state-action mapping space and the extensive initial policy search space. Meanwhile, advancements in large language models (LLMs) have endowed these models with a degree of logical reasoning ability, enabling them to take goal-oriented actions proactively during the initial phase of a robotic task. These models can implicitly generate features of states and uncover underlying patterns in trajectory generation. Yet, in complex manipulative tasks involving rich contact scenarios, LLMs still fall short. Thus, integrating the robust interactive capabilities of reinforcement learning with the strong logical reasoning of LLMs, and enhancing policy search with LLMs, could potentially accelerate the speed of policy searches significantly. In this letter, we introduce a Cognitive Reasoning Trajectory Optimization method. This approach utilizes Low-level Cognitive Control Tuning to enable LLMs with robust logical reasoning to make effective single-step decisions in Markov Decision Process (MDP) tasks. By fitting dynamic models with high-quality cognitive reasoning data and optimizing control strategies, this method constrains the policy search space and enhances the efficiency of trajectory optimization. Experimental results on various manipulative tasks using the Sawyer robot in the Mujoco simulator validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "To ensure learned controllers comply with safety and reliability requirements for reinforcement learning in real-world settings remains challenging. Traditional safety assurance approaches, such as state avoidance and constrained Markov decision processes, often inadequately capture trajectory requirements or may result in overly conservative behaviors. To address these limitations, recent studies advocate the use of formal specification languages such as linear temporal logic (LTL), enabling the derivation of correct-by-construction learning objectives from the specified requirements. However, the sparse rewards associated with LTL specifications make learning extremely difficult, whereas dense heuristic-based rewards risk compromising correctness. In this work, we propose the first method, to our knowledge, that integrates LTL with differentiable simulators, facilitating efficient gradient-based learning directly from LTL specifications by coupling with differentiable paradigms. Our approach introduces soft labeling to achieve differentiable rewards and states, effectively mitigating the sparse-reward issue intrinsic to LTL without compromising objective correctness.

        "title": "HoMeR: Learning In-the-Wild Mobile Manipulation via Hybrid Imitation and Whole-Body Control",
        "abstract": "We introduce HoMeR, an imitation learning framework for mobile manipulation that combines whole-body control with hybrid action modes that handle both long-range and fine-grained motion, enabling effective performance on realistic in-the-wild tasks. At its core is a fast, kinematics-based whole-body controller that maps desired end-effector poses to coordinated motion across the mobile base and arm. Within this reduced end-effector action space, HoMeR learns to switch between absolute pose predictions for long-range movement and relative pose predictions for fine-grained manipulation, offloading low-level coordination to the controller and focusing learning on task-level decisions. We deploy HoMeR on a holonomic mobile manipulator with a 7-DoF arm in a real home. We compare HoMeR to baselines without hybrid actions or whole-body control across 3 simulated and 3 real household tasks such as opening cabinets, sweeping trash, and rearranging pillows. Across tasks, HoMeR achieves an overall success rate of 79.17% using just 20 demonstrations per task, outperforming the next best baseline by 29.17 on average. HoMeR is also compatible with vision-language models and can leverage their internet-scale priors to better generalize to novel object appearances, layouts, and cluttered scenes. In summary, HoMeR moves beyond tabletop settings and demonstrates a scalable path toward sample-efficient, generalizable manipulation in everyday indoor spaces.

        "title": "Mobi-π: Mobilizing Your Robot Learning Policy",
        "abstract": "Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and remains compatible with them. To study policy mobilization, we introduce the Mobi-$\\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, (3) visualization tools for analysis, and (4) several baseline methods. We also propose a novel approach that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to identify optimal robot poses. We show that our approach outperforms baselines in both simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating its effectiveness for policy mobilization.",

        "abstract": "Imitation Learning has become a fundamental approach in robotic manipulation. However, collecting large-scale real-world robot demonstrations is prohibitively expensive. Simulators offer a cost-effective alternative, but the sim-to-real gap make it extremely challenging to scale. Therefore, we introduce RoboTransfer, a diffusion-based video generation framework for robotic data synthesis. Unlike previous methods, RoboTransfer integrates multi-view geometry with explicit control over scene components, such as background and object attributes. By incorporating cross-view feature interactions and global depth/normal conditions, RoboTransfer ensures geometry consistency across views. This framework allows fine-grained control, including background edits and object swaps. Experiments demonstrate that RoboTransfer is capable of generating multi-view videos with enhanced geometric consistency and visual fidelity. In addition, policies trained on the data generated by RoboTransfer achieve a 33.3% relative improvement in the success rate in the DIFF-OBJ setting and a substantial 251% relative improvement in the more challenging DIFF-ALL scenario.

        "abstract": "An important challenge in non-cooperative game theory is coordinating on a single (approximate) equilibrium from many possibilities - a challenge that becomes even more complex when players hold private information. Recommender mechanisms tackle this problem by recommending strategies to players based on their reported type profiles. A key consideration in such mechanisms is to ensure that players are incentivized to participate, report their private information truthfully, and follow the recommendations. While previous work has focused on designing recommender mechanisms for one-shot and extensive-form games, these approaches cannot be effectively applied to stochastic games, particularly if we constrain recommendations to be Markov stationary policies. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel bi-level reinforcement learning approach for automatically designing recommender mechanisms in Bayesian stochastic games. Our method produces a mechanism represented by a parametric function (such as a neural network), and is therefore highly efficient at execution time. Experimental results on two repeated and two stochastic games demonstrate that our approach achieves social welfare levels competitive with cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines, while also providing significantly improved incentive properties.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in language modeling and vision stem from training large models on diverse, multi-task data. This paradigm has had limited impact in value-based reinforcement learning (RL), where improvements are often driven by small models trained in a single-task context. This is because in multi-task RL sparse rewards and gradient conflicts make optimization of temporal difference brittle. Practical workflows for generalist policies therefore avoid online training, instead cloning expert trajectories or distilling collections of single-task policies into one agent. In this work, we show that the use of high-capacity value models trained via cross-entropy and conditioned on learnable task embeddings addresses the problem of task interference in online RL, allowing for robust and scalable multi-task training. We test our approach on 7 multi-task benchmarks with over 280 unique tasks, spanning high degree-of-freedom humanoid control and discrete vision-based RL. We find that, despite its simplicity, the proposed approach leads to state-of-the-art single and multi-task performance, as well as sample-efficient transfer to new tasks.",

        "abstract": "Physical intelligence -- anticipating and shaping the world from partial, multisensory observations -- is critical for next-generation world models. We propose FOLIAGE, a physics-informed multimodal world model for unbounded accretive surface growth. In its Action-Perception loop, a unified context encoder maps images, mesh connectivity, and point clouds to a shared latent state. A physics-aware predictor, conditioned on physical control actions, advances this latent state in time to align with the target latent of the surface, yielding a Modality-Agnostic Growth Embedding (MAGE) that interfaces with critic heads for downstream objectives. FOLIAGE's Accretive Graph Network (AGN) captures dynamic connectivity through Age Positional Encoding and Energy-Gated Message-Passing. Geometry-Correspondence Fusion and Cross-Patch Masking enhance MAGE's expressiveness, while Hierarchical Pooling balances global context with local dynamics. We create SURF-GARDEN, a world model learning platform comprising a Counterfactual Physics Simulator, a Multimodal Correspondence Extractor, and Evolution Tracing, which generates 7,200 diverse surface-growth sequences. SURF-BENCH, our physical-intelligence evaluation suite, evaluates six core tasks -- topology recognition, inverse material estimation, growth-stage classification, latent roll-out, cross-modal retrieval, and dense correspondence -- and four stress tests -- sensor dropout, zero-shot modality transfer, long-horizon prediction, and physics ablation -- to probe resilience.

However, existing safe RL paradigms inherently struggle to achieve this objective. We propose a method, called Provably Lifetime Safe RL (PLS), that integrates offline safe RL with safe policy deployment to address this challenge. Our proposed method learns a policy offline using return-conditioned supervised learning and then deploys the resulting policy while cautiously optimizing a limited set of parameters, known as target returns, using Gaussian processes (GPs). Theoretically, we justify the use of GPs by analyzing the mathematical relationship between target and actual returns. We then prove that PLS finds near-optimal target returns while guaranteeing safety with high probability. Empirically, we demonstrate that PLS outperforms baselines both in safety and reward performance, thereby achieving the longstanding goal to obtain high rewards while ensuring the safety of a policy throughout the lifetime from learning to operation.",

        "abstract": "Timely and personalized treatment decisions are essential across a wide range of healthcare settings where patient responses vary significantly and evolve over time. Clinical data used to support these decisions are often irregularly sampled, sparse, and noisy. Existing decision support systems commonly rely on discretization and imputation, which can distort critical temporal dynamics and degrade decision quality. Moreover, they often overlook the clinical significance of irregular recording frequencies, filtering out patterns in how and when data is collected. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a natural fit for clinical decision-making, enabling sequential, long-term optimization in dynamic, uncertain environments. However, most existing treatment recommendation systems are model-free and trained solely on offline data, making them sample-inefficient, sensitive to data quality, and poorly generalizable across tasks or cohorts. To address these limitations, we propose MedDreamer, a two-phase model-based RL framework for personalized treatment recommendation. MedDreamer uses a world model with an Adaptive Feature Integration (AFI) module to effectively model irregular, sparse clinical data. Through latent imagination, it simulates plausible patient trajectories to enhance learning, refining its policy using a mix of real and imagined experiences. This enables learning policies that go beyond suboptimal historical decisions while remaining grounded in clinical data. To our knowledge, this is the first application of latent imagination to irregular healthcare data. Evaluations on sepsis and mechanical ventilation (MV) treatment using two large-scale EHR datasets show that MedDreamer outperforms both model-free and model-based baselines in clinical outcomes and off-policy metrics.",

        "abstract": "In the realm of game playing, deep reinforcement learning predominantly relies on visual input to map states to actions. The visual data extracted from the game environment serves as the primary foundation for state representation in reinforcement learning agents. However, humans leverage additional sensory inputs, such as audio cues, which play a pivotal role in perception and decision-making. Therefore, incorporating raw audio along with visual information shows potential for offering valuable insights to reinforcement learning agents. This study advocates for the integration of raw audio samples as complementary information to visual data in state representation. By using raw audio with visual cues, our objective is to enrich the decision-making process of the agent at each stage. Experimental evaluation were conducted employing Deep Q Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms within ViZDoom and Unity reinforcement learning environments. The results of our experiments reveal that augmenting visual information with raw audio samples yields superior rewards and expedites the learning rate compared to relying solely on visual data. Additionally, the findings suggest that considering both visual and audio features enhances the agent’s behavior, a trend observed across Unity and ViZDoom environments. This study underscores the potential advantages of incorporating multisensory information, particularly raw audio, into the state representation of reinforcement learning agents. Such insights contribute to advancing our understanding of how agents perceive and engage with their environments, ultimately enhancing performance in complex gaming scenarios.",

This paper closes this gap by incorporating into the diffusion policy model a process that projects features from the 2D RGB camera image onto a sphere. This enables us to reason about symmetries in SO(3) without explicitly reconstructing a point cloud. We perform extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world that demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both performance and sample efficiency.

        "abstract": "Transformer models (TMs) have exhibited remarkable in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) capabilities, allowing them to generalize to and improve in previously unseen environments without re-training or fine-tuning. This is typically accomplished by imitating the complete learning histories of a source RL algorithm over a substantial amount of pretraining environments, which, however, may transfer suboptimal behaviors inherited from the source algorithm/dataset. Therefore, in this work, we address the issue of inheriting suboptimality from the perspective of dataset preprocessing. Motivated by the success of the weighted empirical risk minimization, we propose a simple yet effective approach, learning history filtering (LHF), to enhance ICRL by reweighting and filtering the learning histories based on their improvement and stability characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, LHF is the first approach to avoid source suboptimality by dataset preprocessing, and can be combined with the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) ICRL algorithms. We substantiate the effectiveness of LHF through a series of experiments conducted on the well-known ICRL benchmarks, encompassing both discrete environments and continuous robotic manipulation tasks, with three SOTA ICRL algorithms (AD, DPT, DICP) as the backbones. LHF exhibits robust performance across a variety of suboptimal scenarios, as well as under varying hyperparameters and sampling strategies. Notably, the superior performance of LHF becomes more pronounced in the presence of noisy data, indicating the significance of filtering learning histories.",

        "abstract": "Effectively utilizing multi-sensory data is important for robots to generalize across diverse tasks. However, the heterogeneous nature of these modalities makes fusion challenging. Existing methods propose strategies to obtain comprehensively fused features but often ignore the fact that each modality requires different levels of attention at different manipulation stages. To address this, we propose a force-guided attention fusion module that adaptively adjusts the weights of visual and tactile features without human labeling. We also introduce a self-supervised future force prediction auxiliary task to reinforce the tactile modality, improve data imbalance, and encourage proper adjustment. Our method achieves an average success rate of 93% across three fine-grained, contactrich tasks in real-world experiments. Further analysis shows that our policy appropriately adjusts attention to each modality at different manipulation stages. The videos can be viewed at https://adaptac-dex.github.io/.",

        "abstract": "The accurate prediction of kinematic configurations, including joint limit violations, collisions, and trajectory anomalies, is essential for ensuring the safety and efficiency of 6-DOF robotic arms in industrial applications. In this study, we develop a novel inverse kinematics (IK) solver based on a data-driven approach utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our model effectively captures the complex spatial relationships governing kinematic behavior by representing the robotic system as a graph—where nodes correspond to joints and edges represent physical linkages. Trained on a dataset of direct kinematics, our GNN-based model infers joint angles given an end-effector position with high accuracy and efficiency. The proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 92% with a 100.0% success rate and a computational runtime of 2.4 ms, outperforming conventional numerical and optimization-based IK solvers. These results highlight the potential of GNNs in real-time inverse kinematics prediction, enabling improved motion planning, reduced computational costs, and enhanced adaptability in dynamic environments.

CALR, along with its variants incorporating gradient clipping and cosine annealing schedules, offers enhanced robustness and faster convergence across diverse optimization tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms CALR’s convergence properties, while empirical evaluations on benchmark functions—Rosenbrock, Himmelblau, and Saddle Point—highlight its efficiency in complex optimization landscapes.

Towards this goal, we propose an extension of the well-established Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner, which simultaneously grows multiple trees around grasp and release states extracted from the guiding video. Our key novelty lies in combining contact states and 3D object poses extracted from the guiding video with a traditional planning algorithm that allows us to solve tasks with sequential dependencies, for example, if an object needs to be placed at a specific location to be grasped later. We also investigate the generalization capabilities of our approach to go beyond the scene depicted in the instructional video. To demonstrate the benefits of the proposed video-guided planning approach, we design a new benchmark with three challenging tasks: (I) 3D re-arrangement of multiple objects between a table and a shelf, (ii) multi-step transfer of an object through a tunnel, and (iii) transferring objects using a tray similar to a waiter transfers dishes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our planning algorithm on several robots, including the Franka Emika Panda and the KUKA KMR iiwa. For a seamless transfer of the obtained plans to the real robot, we develop a trajectory refinement approach formulated as an optimal control problem (OCP).",

Using skew-normal curves fitted along semantically decomposed temporal axes, Chronocept captures nuanced patterns of emergence, decay, and peak relevance. It includes two datasets: Benchmark I (atomic facts) and Benchmark II (multi-sentence passages). Annotations show strong inter-annotator agreement (84% and 89%). Our baselines predict curve parameters - location, scale, and skewness - enabling interpretable, generalizable learning and outperforming classification-based approaches.

        "abstract": "Human videos offer a scalable way to train robot manipulation policies, but lack the action labels needed by standard imitation learning algorithms. Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes.

We show that DQNs can approximate the optimal Q-function on compact sets with arbitrary accuracy and high probability, leveraging residual network approximation theorems and large deviation bounds for the state-action process. We then analyze the convergence of a general Q-learning algorithm for training DQNs in this setting, adapting stochastic approximation theorems. Our analysis emphasizes the interplay between DQN layer count, time discretization, and the role of viscosity solutions (primarily for the value function $V^*$) in addressing potential non-smoothness of the optimal Q-function.

This novel representation also enables the design of an object-centric exploration mechanism, which encourages the agent to interact with objects and discover useful interactions. We benchmark FOCUS in several robotic manipulation settings, where we found that our method can be used to improve manipulation skills. The object-centric world model leads to more accurate predictions of the objects in the scene and it enables more efficient learning. The object-centric exploration strategy fosters interactions with the objects in the environment, such as reaching, moving, and rotating them, and it allows fast adaptation of the agent to sparse reward reinforcement learning tasks.

Force control is important for handling delicate objects such as food. In addition, achieving complex movements is possible by making robot motions based on human teachings. Four-channel bilateral control is proposed, which enables the simultaneous teaching of position and force information. Moreover, methods have been developed to reproduce motions obtained through human teachings and generate adaptive motions using learning. We demonstrated the effectiveness of these methods for food handling tasks in the Food Topping Challenge at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2024). For the task of serving salmon roe on rice, we achieved the best performance because of the high reproducibility and quick motion of the proposed method. Further, for the task of picking fried chicken, we successfully picked the most pieces of fried chicken among all participating teams.

Autonomous driving systems often encounter challenges in processing dynamic and irregular input dimensions due to sensor variations or environmental changes. The proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating an adaptive observation encoder, which processes variable-dimension inputs into a fixed-length representation, enabling effective integration into policy networks. A dynamic policy network, optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), ensures robust decision-making by adapting to changes in input dimensions and environmental conditions. The framework is further enhanced by a multi-objective reward shaping mechanism that prioritizes safety, efficiency, and passenger comfort. The methodology is evaluated using a simulated urban driving environment, demonstrating superior performance in terms of collision avoidance, fuel efficiency, and policy stability compared to traditional reinforcement learning approaches. Results indicate a significant improvement in handling variable observations, with a 35% reduction in collision rates and a 20% enhancement in efficiency metrics.

We tested our method on standard datasets, including a new wireless communication dataset, and found that not only it improves prediction accuracy but also enhances the performance of end application employing the forecasting model. This research provides a basis for creating forecasting systems that better connect prediction and decision-making in various practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Stable Q-value estimation is critical for effective policy learning in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), especially continuous control tasks. Traditional algorithms like Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic (TD3) policy gradients rely on Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss for Q-value approximation, which may cause instability due to misestimation and overestimation biases. Although distributional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like C51 have improved robustness in discrete action spaces, their application to continuous control remains computationally expensive owing to distribution projection needs. To address this, we propose a classification-based Q-value learning method that reformulates Q-value estimation as a classification problem rather than a regression task. Replacing MSE loss with cross-entropy (CE) and Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence losses, the proposed method improves learning stability and mitigates overestimation errors. Our statistical analysis across 30 independent runs shows that the approach achieves an approximately 10% lower Q-value estimation error in the pendulum environment and a 40–60% reduced training time compared to SAC and Continuous Twin Delayed Distributed Deep Deterministic (CTD4) Policy Gradient. Experimental results on OpenAI Gym benchmark environments demonstrate that our approach, with up to 77% fewer parameters, outperforms the SAC and CTD4 policy gradients regarding training stability and convergence speed, while maintaining a competitive final policy performance.",

        "abstract": "To realize delicate manipulation of soft/rigid objects, incorporating some notion of force into the controller is essential. Such forces can either be measured explicitly via onboard sensors or estimated from visual input through an offline-trained network. For visuomotor control, unlike state-based models, visual input (i.e. RGB images) is first encoded into a low-dimensional latent before feeding into some low-level policy. The encoder network is usually trained end-to-end using supervised policy loss or pre-trained with unsupervised RGB reconstruction loss. This work proposes a learning approach that implicitly integrates force-relevant features into the latent image encoding, rather than explicit force integration. Our proposal, ForceMapping, incorporates a supervised force prediction loss as an auxiliary optimization objective alongside unsupervised RGB reconstruction loss or policy loss. For soft bodies, forces are estimated from the raw RGB image input, given the correlation between object deformation and imposed forces. To validate our approach, we designed a soft object stacking task requiring force-aware manipulation. Soft-body deformation was efficiently rendered through a fast and stable pipeline, utilizing states obtained from rigid-body simulation. Our experiments demonstrated that ForceMapping encouraged attention to and encoding of force-relevant features, leading to increased task success rates (from 25% to 75%) and reduced deviations from a target critical load (from 300% to 40%) compared to only-RGB model.

To address these limitations, we propose a Classifier-Free Shortcut Diffusion Policy (CF-SDP) that integrates classifier-free guidance with shortcut-based acceleration, enabling efficient task-specific action generation while significantly improving inference speed. Furthermore, we extend diffusion modeling to the SO(3) manifold in shortcut model, defining the forward and reverse processes in its tangent space with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. This ensures stable and accurate rotational estimation, enhancing the effectiveness of diffusion-based control. Our approach achieves nearly 5x acceleration in diffusion inference compared to DDIM-based Diffusion Policy while maintaining task performance.

This paper introduces an innovative approach that combines Genetic Programming (GP) with a Transformer trained through Reinforcement Learning (GPRT), specifically designed to tackle the complexities of dynamic scheduling scenarios. GPRT leverages the Transformer to refine heuristics generated by GP while also seeding and guiding the evolution of GP. This dual functionality enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of the scheduling heuristics, enabling them to better respond to the dynamic nature of real-world tasks. The efficacy of this integrated approach is demonstrated through a practical application in container terminal truck scheduling, where the GPRT method outperforms traditional GP, standalone Transformer methods, and other state-of-the-art competitors. The key contribution of this research is the development of the GPRT method, which showcases a novel combination of GP and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to produce robust and efficient scheduling solutions. Importantly, GPRT is not limited to container port truck scheduling; it offers a versatile framework applicable to various dynamic scheduling challenges. Its practicality, coupled with its interpretability and ease of modification, makes it a valuable tool for diverse real-world scenarios.",

The success of most existing works is built on the critical assumption that the dynamic is fixed, which is unrealistic in many open-world scenarios, such as drone delivery and online chatting, where agents may need to deal with environments with unpredictable changing dynamics (hereafter, real non-stationary environment). Therefore, learning changing dynamics in a real non-stationary environment offers both significant benefits and challenges. This paper proposes a new model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that proactively and dynamically detects possible changes and Learns these Latent and Changing Dynamics (LLCD) in a latent Markovian space for real non-stationary environments. To ensure the Markovian property of the RL model and improve computational efficiency, we employ a latent space model to learn the environment’s transition dynamics. Furthermore, we perform online change detection in the latent space to promptly identify change points in non-stationary environments. Then, we utilize the detected information to help the agent adapt to new conditions. Experiments indicate that the rewards of the proposed algorithm accumulate for the most rapid adaptions to environmental change, among other benefits.

In this paper, we focus on random exploration data-video sequences and actions produced autonomously via motions to randomly sampled positions in the workspace-as an often overlooked resource for training visuo-motor policies in robotic manipulation. Within the scope of imitation learning, we examine random exploration data through two paradigms: (a) by investigating the use of random exploration video frames with three self-supervised learning objectives-reconstruction, contrastive, and distillation losses-and evaluating their applicability to visual pre-training; and (b) by analyzing random motor commands in the context of a staged learning framework to assess their effectiveness in autonomous data collection. Towards this goal, we present a large-scale experimental study based on over 750 hours of robot data collection, comprising 400 successful and 12,000 failed episodes. Our results indicate that: (a) among the three self-supervised learning objectives, contrastive loss appears most effective for visual pre-training while leveraging random exploration video frames; (b) data collected with random motor commands may play a crucial role in balancing the training data distribution and improving success rates in autonomous data collection within this study.

        "abstract": "Model Predictive Control (MPC) has been demonstrated to be effective in continuous control tasks. When a world model and a value function are available, planning a sequence of actions ahead of time leads to a better policy. Existing methods typically obtain the value function and the corresponding policy in a model-free manner. However, we find that such an approach struggles with complex tasks, resulting in poor policy learning and inaccurate value estimation. To address this problem, we leverage the strengths of MPC itself. In this work, we introduce Bootstrapped Model Predictive Control (BMPC), a novel algorithm that performs policy learning in a bootstrapped manner. BMPC learns a network policy by imitating an MPC expert, and in turn, uses this policy to guide the MPC process. Combined with model-based TD-learning, our policy learning yields better value estimation and further boosts the efficiency of MPC. We also introduce a lazy reanalyze mechanism, which enables computationally efficient imitation learning. Our method achieves superior performance over prior works on diverse continuous control tasks. In particular, on challenging high-dimensional locomotion tasks, BMPC significantly improves data efficiency while also enhancing asymptotic performance and training stability, with comparable training time and smaller network sizes.

        "abstract": "Motion planning involves determining a sequence of robot configurations to reach a desired pose, subject to movement and safety constraints. Traditional motion planning finds collision-free paths, but this is overly restrictive in clutter, where it may not be possible for a robot to accomplish a task without contact. In addition, contacts range from relatively benign (e.g., brushing a soft pillow) to more dangerous (e.g., toppling a glass vase). Due to this diversity, it is difficult to characterize which contacts may be acceptable or unacceptable. In this paper, we propose IMPACT, a novel motion planning framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to infer environment semantics, identifying which parts of the environment can best tolerate contact based on object properties and locations. Our approach uses the VLM's outputs to produce a dense 3D\"cost map\"that encodes contact tolerances and seamlessly integrates with standard motion planners. We perform experiments using 20 simulation and 10 real-world scenes and assess using task success rate, object displacements, and feedback from human evaluators. Our results over 3620 simulation and 200 real-world trials suggest that IMPACT enables efficient contact-rich motion planning in cluttered settings while outperforming alternative methods and ablations.

        "abstract": "The perceptual system design for humanoid robots poses unique challenges due to inherent structural constraints that cause severe self-occlusion and limited field-of-view (FOV). We present HumanoidPano, a novel hybrid cross-modal perception framework that synergistically integrates panoramic vision and LiDAR sensing to overcome these limitations. Unlike conventional robot perception systems that rely on monocular cameras or standard multi-sensor configurations, our method establishes geometrically-aware modality alignment through a spherical vision transformer, enabling seamless fusion of 360 visual context with LiDAR's precise depth measurements. First, Spherical Geometry-aware Constraints (SGC) leverage panoramic camera ray properties to guide distortion-regularized sampling offsets for geometric alignment. Second, Spatial Deformable Attention (SDA) aggregates hierarchical 3D features via spherical offsets, enabling efficient 360{\\deg}-to-BEV fusion with geometrically complete object representations. Third, Panoramic Augmentation (AUG) combines cross-view transformations and semantic alignment to enhance BEV-panoramic feature consistency during data augmentation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the 360BEV-Matterport benchmark. Real-world deployment on humanoid platforms validates the system's capability to generate accurate BEV segmentation maps through panoramic-LiDAR co-perception, directly enabling downstream navigation tasks in complex environments.

        "abstract": "Sequentially grasping multiple objects with multi-fingered hands is common in daily life, where humans can fully leverage the dexterity of their hands to enclose multiple objects. However, the diversity of object geometries and the complex contact interactions required for high-DOF hands to grasp one object while enclosing another make sequential multi-object grasping challenging for robots. In this paper, we propose SeqMultiGrasp, a system for sequentially grasping objects with a four-fingered Allegro Hand. We focus on sequentially grasping two objects, ensuring that the hand fully encloses one object before lifting it and then grasps the second object without dropping the first. Our system first synthesizes single-object grasp candidates, where each grasp is constrained to use only a subset of the hand's links. These grasps are then validated in a physics simulator to ensure stability and feasibility. Next, we merge the validated single-object grasp poses to construct multi-object grasp configurations. For real-world deployment, we train a diffusion model conditioned on point clouds to propose grasp poses, followed by a heuristic-based execution strategy. We test our system using $8 \\times 8$ object combinations in simulation and $6 \\times 3$ object combinations in real. Our diffusion-based grasp model obtains an average success rate of 65.8% over 1600 simulation trials and 56.7% over 90 real-world trials, suggesting that it is a promising approach for sequential multi-object grasping with multi-fingered hands.

To address those challenges, we propose Adapt3R, a general-purpose 3D observation encoder which synthesizes data from calibrated RGBD cameras into a vector that can be used as conditioning for arbitrary IL algorithms. The key idea is to use a pretrained 2D backbone to extract semantic information, using 3D only as a medium to localize this information with respect to the end-effector.

        "abstract": "Object affordance reasoning, the ability to infer object functionalities based on physical properties, is fundamental for task-oriented planning and activities in both humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This capability, required for planning and executing daily activities in a task-oriented manner, relies on commonsense knowledge of object physics and functionalities, extending beyond simple object recognition. Current computational models for affordance reasoning from perception lack generalizability, limiting their applicability in novel scenarios. Meanwhile, comprehensive Large Language Models (LLMs) with emerging reasoning capabilities are challenging to deploy on local devices for task-oriented manipulations. Here, we introduce LVIS-Aff, a large-scale dataset comprising 1,496 tasks and 119k images, designed to enhance the generalizability of affordance reasoning from perception. Utilizing this dataset, we develop Afford-X, an end-to-end trainable affordance reasoning model that incorporates Verb Attention and Bi-Fusion modules to improve multi-modal understanding. This model achieves up to a 12.1% performance improvement over the best-reported results from non-LLM methods, while also demonstrating a 1.2% enhancement compared to our previous conference paper. Additionally, it maintains a compact 187M parameter size and infers nearly 50 times faster than the GPT-4V API. Our work demonstrates the potential for efficient, generalizable affordance reasoning models that can be deployed on local devices for task-oriented manipulations. We showcase Afford-X's effectiveness in enabling task-oriented manipulations for robots across various tasks and environments, underscoring its efficiency and broad implications for advancing robotics and AI systems in real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "Multitask Representation Learning (MRL) has emerged as a prevalent technique to improve sample efficiency in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Empirical studies have found that training agents on multiple tasks simultaneously within online and transfer learning environments can greatly improve efficiency. Despite its popularity, a comprehensive theoretical framework that elucidates its operational efficacy remains incomplete. Prior analyses have predominantly assumed that agents either possess a pre-known representation function or utilize functions from a linear class, where both are impractical. The complexity of real-world applications typically requires the use of sophisticated, non-linear functions such as neural networks as representation function, which are not pre-existing but must be learned. Our work tries to fill the gap by extending the analysis to \\textit{unknown non-linear} representations, giving a comprehensive analysis for its mechanism in online and transfer learning setting. We consider the setting that an agent simultaneously playing $M$ contextual bandits (or MDPs), developing a shared representation function $\\phi$ from a non-linear function class $\\Phi$ using our novel Generalized Functional Upper Confidence Bound algorithm (GFUCB). We formally prove that this approach yields a regret upper bound that outperforms the lower bound associated with learning $M$ separate tasks, marking the first demonstration of MRL's efficacy in a general function class. This framework also explains the contribution of representations to transfer learning when faced with new, yet related tasks, and identifies key conditions for successful transfer. Empirical experiments further corroborate our theoretical findings.",

Due to their ability to handle complex data distributions and their strong model capacity, generative models can be effectively incorporated into decision-making systems by generating trajectories that guide agents toward high-reward state-action regions or intermediate sub-goals. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the application of generative models in decision-making tasks. We classify seven fundamental types of generative models: energy-based models, generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, diffusion models, generative flow networks, and autoregressive models. Regarding their applications, we categorize their functions into three main roles: controllers, modelers and optimizers, and discuss how each role contributes to decision-making. Furthermore, we examine the deployment of these models across five critical real-world decision-making scenarios. Finally, we summarize the strengths and limitations of current approaches and propose three key directions for advancing next-generation generative directive models: high-performance algorithms, large-scale generalized decision-making models, and self-evolving and adaptive models.",

        "abstract": "Imitation learning techniques have been shown to be highly effective in real-world control scenarios, such as robotics. However, these approaches not only suffer from compounding error issues but also require human experts to provide complete trajectories. Although there exist interactive methods where an expert oversees the robot and intervenes if needed, these extensions usually only utilize the data collected during intervention periods and ignore the feedback signal hidden in non-intervention timesteps. In this work, we create a model to formulate how the interventions occur in such cases, and show that it is possible to learn a policy with just a handful of expert interventions. Our key insight is that it is possible to get crucial information about the quality of the current state and the optimality of the chosen action from expert feedback, regardless of the presence or the absence of intervention. We evaluate our method on various discrete and continuous simulation environments, a real-world robotic manipulation task, as well as a human subject study.

        "abstract": "Although many popular reinforcement learning algorithms are underpinned by $f$-divergence regularization, their sample complexity with respect to the \\emph{regularized objective} still lacks a tight characterization. In this paper, we analyze $f$-divergence-regularized offline policy learning. For reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, arguably the most commonly used one, we give the first $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-1})$ sample complexity under single-policy concentrability for contextual bandits, surpassing existing $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-1})$ bound under all-policy concentrability and $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ bound under single-policy concentrability. Our analysis for general function approximation leverages the principle of pessimism in the face of uncertainty to refine a mean-value-type argument to its extreme. This in turn leads to a novel moment-based technique, effectively bypassing the need for uniform control over the discrepancy between any two functions in the function class. We further propose a lower bound, demonstrating that a multiplicative dependency on single-policy concentrability is necessary to maximally exploit the strong convexity of reverse KL. In addition, for $f$-divergences with strongly convex $f$, to which reverse KL \\emph{does not} belong, we show that the sharp sample complexity $\\tilde{\\Theta}(\\epsilon^{-1})$ is achievable even without single-policy concentrability. In this case, the algorithm design can get rid of pessimistic estimators. We further extend our analysis to dueling bandits, and we believe these results take a significant step toward a comprehensive understanding of $f$-divergence-regularized policy learning.",

        "abstract": "The integration of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) into visuo-motor robot learning has emerged as a promising alternative to training visual encoders from scratch. However, PVRs face critical challenges in the context of policy learning, including temporal entanglement and an inability to generalise even in the presence of minor scene perturbations. These limitations hinder performance in tasks requiring temporal awareness and robustness to scene changes. This work identifies these shortcomings and proposes solutions to address them. First, we augment PVR features with temporal perception and a sense of task completion, effectively disentangling them in time. Second, we introduce a module that learns to selectively attend to task-relevant local features, enhancing robustness when evaluated on out-of-distribution scenes. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements, particularly in PVRs trained with masking objectives, and validate the effectiveness of our enhancements in addressing PVR-specific limitations.",

Our method leverages VLMs to generate initial preference labels, which are then filtered to identify uncertain cases for targeted human annotation. Additionally, we adapt VLMs using a self-supervised inverse dynamics loss to improve alignment with evolving policies. Experiments on Meta-World manipulation tasks demonstrate that PrefVLM achieves comparable or superior success rates to state-of-the-art methods while using up to 2 x fewer human annotations.

We propose such a justification for asymmetric actor-critic algorithms with linear function approximators by adapting a finite-time convergence analysis to this setting. The resulting finite-time bound reveals that the asymmetric critic eliminates error terms arising from aliasing in the agent state.",

        "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained widespread adoption in control and decision-making tasks due to its strong performance in dynamic environments. However, DRL agents are vulnerable to noisy observations and adversarial attacks, and concerns about the adversarial robustness of DRL systems have emerged. Recent efforts have focused on addressing these robustness issues by establishing rigorous theoretical guarantees for the returns achieved by DRL agents in adversarial settings. Among these approaches, policy smoothing has proven to be an effective and scalable method for certifying the robustness of DRL agents. Nevertheless, existing certifiably robust DRL relies on policies trained with simple Gaussian augmentations, resulting in a suboptimal trade-off between certified robustness and certified return. To address this issue, we introduce a novel paradigm dubbed \\texttt{C}ertified-r\\texttt{A}dius-\\texttt{M}aximizing \\texttt{P}olicy (\\texttt{CAMP}) training. \\texttt{CAMP} is designed to enhance DRL policies, achieving better utility without compromising provable robustness. By leveraging the insight that the global certified radius can be derived from local certified radii based on training-time statistics, \\texttt{CAMP} formulates a surrogate loss related to the local certified radius and optimizes the policy guided by this surrogate loss. We also introduce \\textit{policy imitation} as a novel technique to stabilize \\texttt{CAMP} training. Experimental results demonstrate that \\texttt{CAMP} significantly improves the robustness-return trade-off across various tasks. Based on the results, \\texttt{CAMP} can achieve up to twice the certified expected return compared to that of baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/NeuralSec/camp-robust-rl.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous drone racing has risen as a challenging robotic benchmark for testing the limits of learning, perception, planning, and control. Expert human pilots are able to agilely fly a drone through a race track by mapping the real-time feed from a single onboard camera directly to control commands. Recent works in autonomous drone racing attempting direct pixel-to-commands control policies (without explicit state estimation) have relied on either intermediate representations that simplify the observation space or performed extensive bootstrapping using Imitation Learning (IL). This paper introduces an approach that learns policies from scratch, allowing a quadrotor to autonomously navigate a race track by directly mapping raw onboard camera pixels to control commands, just as human pilots do. By leveraging model-based reinforcement learning~(RL) - specifically DreamerV3 - we train visuomotor policies capable of agile flight through a race track using only raw pixel observations. While model-free RL methods such as PPO struggle to learn under these conditions, DreamerV3 efficiently acquires complex visuomotor behaviors. Moreover, because our policies learn directly from pixel inputs, the perception-aware reward term employed in previous RL approaches to guide the training process is no longer needed. Our experiments demonstrate in both simulation and real-world flight how the proposed approach can be deployed on agile quadrotors. This approach advances the frontier of vision-based autonomous flight and shows that model-based RL is a promising direction for real-world robotics.",

        "abstract": "In human-robot collaborative tasks, learning-based models that can deal with behavior beyond the scope of human description are progressing rapidly. Deep learning is effective in capturing complex nonlinear relationships, making it valuable in scenarios with intricate interactions between the environment and tasks, such as collaborative tasks. Deep learning improves the performance by incorporating multiple information sources. Human knowledge, which is regarded as supplemental information obtained from the environment, has been shown to enhance the generalization ability of task execution when it is appropriately incorporated into the learning process for robot motion generation. Among the various models, those that utilize action labels subjectively defined by humans for robot behavior enable the robot to comprehend its own actions better, leading to higher generalization. This approach also suggests that estimating human actions contributes to predicting robot movements in human-robot collaboration (HRC). However, the performance of learning-based methods is significantly influenced by the quality of the training data. Therefore, capturing appropriate human information and integrating this information into the learning process are critical for improving the ability of the robot to learn collaborative tasks. In this study, we propose a learning model that not only provides a robot with action labels for its own behavior but also includes human action labels, encouraging the robot to respond to human actions. The optimal amount of human information to be used in learning is evaluated by adjusting the methods for defining human action labels and the quantity of human data utilized. Experiments were conducted with a task in which the robot handled the manipulation of jigs in an assembly operation involving both humans and robots. The results of the learning process suggest that estimating human behavior can assist in generating collaborative robot actions.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent agents, such as robots and virtual agents, must understand the dynamics of complex social interactions to interact with humans. Effectively representing social dynamics is challenging because we require multi-modal, synchronized observations to understand a scene. We explore how using a single modality, the pose behavior, of multiple individuals in a social interaction can be used to generate nonverbal social cues for the facilitator of that interaction. The facilitator acts to make a social interaction proceed smoothly and is an essential role for intelligent agents to replicate in human-robot interactions. In this paper, we adapt an existing diffusion behavior cloning model to learn and replicate facilitator behaviors. Furthermore, we evaluate two representations of pose observations from a scene, one representation has pre-processing applied and one does not. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new use for diffusion behavior cloning for pose generation in social interactions. The second is to understand the relationship between performance and computational load for generating social pose behavior using two different techniques for collecting scene observations. As such, we are essentially testing the effectiveness of two different types of conditioning for a diffusion model. We then evaluate the resulting generated behavior from each technique using quantitative measures such as mean per-joint position error (MPJPE), training time, and inference time. Additionally, we plot training and inference time against MPJPE to examine the trade-offs between efficiency and performance. Our results suggest that the further pre-processed data can successfully condition diffusion models to generate realistic social behavior, with reasonable trade-offs in accuracy and processing time. Future work will focus on extending this approach to generate multiple nonverbal social cues, on generalizing this method to multiple types of social activity, and on evaluating the results using human evaluators using a virtual agent or robot as a facilitator.",

While there have been attempts to train robots using trial-and-error experiments, the amount of data used in such experiments remains substantially low and hence makes the learner prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we take the leap of increasing the available training data to 40 times more than prior work, leading to a dataset size of 50K data points collected over 700 hours of robot grasping attempts. This allows us to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the task of predicting grasp locations without severe overfitting. In our formulation, we recast the regression problem to an 18-way binary classification over image patches. We also present a multi-stage learning approach where a CNN trained in one stage is used to collect hard negatives in subsequent stages. Our experiments clearly show the benefit of using large-scale datasets (and multi-stage training) for the task of grasping. We also compare to several baselines and show state-of-the-art performance on generalization to unseen objects for grasping.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning provides a powerful and flexible framework for automated acquisition of robotic motion skills. However, applying reinforcement learning requires a sufficiently detailed representation of the state, including the configuration of task-relevant objects. We present an approach that automates state-space construction by learning a state representation directly from camera images. Our method uses a deep spatial autoencoder to acquire a set of feature points that describe the environment for the current task, such as the positions of objects, and then learns a motion skill with these feature points using an efficient reinforcement learning method based on local linear models. The resulting controller reacts continuously to the learned feature points, allowing the robot to dynamically manipulate objects in the world with closed-loop control. We demonstrate our method with a PR2 robot on tasks that include pushing a free-standing toy block, picking up a bag of rice using a spatula, and hanging a loop of rope on a hook at various positions. In each task, our method automatically learns to track task-relevant objects and manipulate their configuration with the robot's arm.",

Rather than hand-design a dynamics model for the task, our approach uses a novel deep architecture and learning algorithm, learning controllers for complex tasks directly from data.

It is challenging for a roboticist to program a robot for each of these object types and for each of their instantiations. In this work, we present a novel approach to manipulation planning based on the idea that many household objects share similarly-operated object parts. We formulate the manipulation planning as a structured prediction problem and design a deep learning model that can handle large noise in the manipulation demonstrations and learns features from three different modalities: point-clouds, language and trajectory. In order to collect a large number of manipulation demonstrations for different objects, we developed a new crowd-sourcing platform called Robobarista. We test our model on our dataset consisting of 116 objects with 249 parts along with 250 language instructions, for which there are 1225 crowd-sourced manipulation demonstrations. We further show that our robot can even manipulate objects it has never seen before.",

However, current motion skill learning methods typically restrict the behavior to a compact, low-dimensional representation, limiting its expressiveness and generality. In this paper, we extend a recently developed policy search method [1] and use it to learn a range of dynamic manipulation behaviors with highly general policy representations, without using known models or example demonstrations. Our approach learns a set of trajectories for the desired motion skill by using iteratively refitted time-varying linear models, and then unifies these trajectories into a single control policy that can generalize to new situations. To enable this method to run on a real robot, we introduce several improvements that reduce the sample count and automate parameter selection. We show that our method can acquire fast, fluent behaviors after only minutes of interaction time, and can learn robust controllers for complex tasks, including putting together a toy airplane, stacking tight-fitting lego blocks, placing wooden rings onto tight-fitting pegs, inserting a shoe tree into a shoe, and screwing bottle caps onto bottles.",

We identify five robotic priors and explain how they can be used for representation learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a simulated slot car racing task and a simulated navigation task with distracting moving objects.

Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning offers to robotics a framework and set of tools for the design of sophisticated and hard-to-engineer behaviors. Conversely, the challenges of robotic problems provide both inspiration, impact, and validation for developments in reinforcement learning. The relationship between disciplines has sufficient promise to be likened to that between physics and mathematics. In this article, we attempt to strengthen the links between the two research communities by providing a survey of work in reinforcement learning for behavior generation in robots. We highlight both key challenges in robot reinforcement learning as well as notable successes. We discuss how contributions tamed the complexity of the domain and study the role of algorithms, representations, and prior knowledge in achieving these successes. As a result, a particular focus of our paper lies on the choice between model-based and model-free as well as between value-function-based and policy-search methods. By analyzing a simple problem in some detail we demonstrate how reinforcement learning approaches may be profitably applied, and we note throughout open questions and the tremendous potential for future research.",

        "abstract": "Policy search is a subfield in reinforcement learning which focuses on finding good parameters for a given policy parametrization. It is well suited for robotics as it can cope with high-dimensional state and action spaces, one of the main challenges in robot learning. We review recent successes of both model-free and model-based policy search in robot learning.Model-free policy search is a general approach to learn policies based on sampled trajectories. We classify model-free methods based on their policy evaluation strategy, policy update strategy, and exploration strategy and present a unified view on existing algorithms. Learning a policy is often easier than learning an accurate forward model, and, hence, model-free methods are more frequently used in practice. However, for each sampled trajectory, it is necessary to interact with the robot, which can be time consuming and challenging in practice. Model-based policy search addresses this problem by first learning a simulator of the robot's dynamics from data. Subsequently, the simulator generates trajectories that are used for policy learning. For both model-free and model-based policy search methods, we review their respective properties and their applicability to robotic systems.",

In this paper, we similarly generalize the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to Bregman ADMM (BADMM), which allows the choice of different Bregman divergences to exploit the structure of problems. BADMM provides a unified framework for ADMM and its variants, including generalized ADMM, inexact ADMM and Bethe ADMM. We establish the global convergence and the O(1/T) iteration complexity for BADMM. In some cases, BADMM can be faster than ADMM by a factor of O(n/ln n) where n is the dimensionality. In solving the linear program of mass transportation problem, BADMM leads to massive parallelism and can easily run on GPU. BADMM is several times faster than highly optimized commercial software Gurobi.",

In this work, we apply a deep learning approach to solve this problem, which avoids time-consuming hand-design of features. This presents two main challenges. First, we need to evaluate a huge number of candidate grasps. In order to make detection fast and robust, we present a two-step cascaded system with two deep networks, where the top detections from the first are re-evaluated by the second. The first network has fewer features, is faster to run, and can effectively prune out unlikely candidate grasps. The second, with more features, is slower but has to run only on the top few detections. Second, we need to handle multimodal inputs effectively, for which we present a method that applies structured regularization on the weights based on multimodal group regularization. We show that our method improves performance on an RGBD robotic grasping dataset, and can be used to successfully execute grasps on two different robotic platforms.",

In contrast, obstacle avoidance remains a challenging task for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) which operate at low altitude in cluttered environments. Unlike large vehicles, MAVs can only carry very light sensors, such as cameras, making autonomous navigation through obstacles much more challenging. In this paper, we describe a system that navigates a small quadrotor helicopter autonomously at low altitude through natural forest environments. Using only a single cheap camera to perceive the environment, we are able to maintain a constant velocity of up to 1.5m/s. Given a small set of human pilot demonstrations, we use recent state-of-the-art imitation learning techniques to train a controller that can avoid trees by adapting the MAVs heading. We demonstrate the performance of our system in a more controlled environment indoors, and in real natural forest environments outdoors.",

The basic idea is to introduce a feature-based image classifier in front of a reinforcement learning algorithm. The classifier partitions the visual space according to the presence or absence of few highly informative local descriptors that are incrementally selected in a sequence of attempts to remove perceptual aliasing. We also address the problem of fighting overfitting in such a greedy algorithm. Finally, we show how high-level visual features can be generated when the power of local descriptors is insufficient for completely disambiguating the aliased states. This is done by building a hierarchy of composite features that consist of recursive spatial combinations of visual features. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms by solving three visual navigation tasks and a visual version of the classical \"Car on the Hill\" control problem.",

The long-term goal of our work is to get away from precise, but very expensive robotic systems and to develop affordable, potentially imprecise, self-adaptive manipulator systems that can interactively perform tasks such as playing with children. In this paper, we demonstrate how a low-cost off-the-shelf robotic system can learn closed-loop policies for a stacking task in only a handful of trials-from scratch. Our manipulator is inaccurate and provides no pose feedback. For learning a controller in the work space of a Kinect-style depth camera, we use a model-based reinforcement learning technique. Our learning method is data efficient, reduces model bias, and deals with several noise sources in a principled way during long-term planning.

        "abstract": "Sequential prediction problems such as imitation learning, where future observations depend on previous predictions (actions), violate the common i.i.d. assumptions made in statistical learning. This leads to poor performance in theory and often in practice. Some recent approaches provide stronger guarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they train either non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number of iterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a stationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in an online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance under the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings. We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two challenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling problem.",

        "abstract": "\n \n Policy search is a successful approach to reinforcement learning. However, policy improvements often result in the loss of information. Hence, it has been marred by premature convergence and implausible solutions. As first suggested in the context of covariant policy gradients, many of these problems may be addressed by constraining the information loss. In this paper, we continue this path of reasoning and suggest the Relative Entropy Policy Search (REPS) method. The resulting method differs significantly from previous policy gradient approaches and yields an exact update step. It can be shown to work well on typical reinforcement learning benchmark problems.\n \n",

        "abstract": "Most vision-based approaches to mobile robotics suffer from the limitations imposed by stereo obstacle detection, which is short range and prone to failure. We present a self-supervised learning process for long-range vision that is able to accurately classify complex terrain at distances up to the horizon, thus allowing superior strategic planning. The success of the learning process is due to the self-supervised training data that are generated on every frame: robust, visually consistent labels from a stereo module; normalized wide-context input windows; and a discriminative and concise feature representation. A deep hierarchical network is trained to extract informative and meaningful features from an input image, and the features are used to train a real-time classifier to predict traversability. The trained classifier sees obstacles and paths from 5 to more than 100 m, far beyond the maximum stereo range of 12 m, and adapts very quickly to new environments. The process was developed and tested on the LAGR (Learning Applied to Ground Robots) mobile robot. Results from a ground truth data set, as well as field test results, are given. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The policy gradient approach is amenable to analysis by information geometric methods.

Investigation of this approach leads to a covariant gradient ascent rule. Interesting properties of this rule are discussed, including its relation with actor-critic style reinforcement learning algorithms. The algorithms discussed here are computationally quite efficient and on some interesting problems lead to dramatic performance improvement over noncovariant rules.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a complete design methodology for Cartesian position based visual servo control for robots with a single camera mounted at the end-effector. Position based visual servo control requires the explicit calculation of the relative position and orientation (POSE) of the workpiece object with respect to the camera. This is accomplished using image plane measurements of a number of known feature points on the object, and then applying an extended Kalman filter to obtain a recursive solution of the photogrammetric equations, and to properly combine redundant measurements. The control is then designed by specifying the desired trajectories with respect to the object and forming the control error in the end-effector frame. The implementation using a distributed computer architecture is described. An experimental system has been built and used to evaluate the performance of the POSE estimation and the position based visual servo control. Several results for relative trajectory control and target tracking are presented. Results of the experiments showing the effect of loss of some of the redundant features are also presented.",

        "abstract": "Linear reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like least-squares temporal difference learning (LSTD) require basis functions that span approximation spaces of potential value functions. This article investigates methods to construct these bases from samples. We hypothesize that an ideal approximation spaces should encode diffusion distances and that slow feature analysis (SFA) constructs such spaces. To validate our hypothesis we provide theoretical statements about the LSTD value approximation error and induced metric of approximation spaces constructed by SFA and the state-of-the-art methods Krylov bases and proto-value functions (PVF). In particular, we prove that SFA minimizes the average (over all tasks in the same environment) bound on the above approximation error. Compared to other methods, SFA is very sensitive to sampling and can sometimes fail to encode the whole state space. We derive a novel importance sampling modification to compensate for this effect. Finally, the LSTD and least squares policy iteration (LSPI) performance of approximation spaces constructed by Krylov bases, PVF, SFA and PCA is compared in benchmark tasks and a visual robot navigation experiment (both in a realistic simulation and with a robot). The results support our hypothesis and suggest that (i) SFA provides subspace-invariant features for MDPs with self-adjoint transition operators, which allows strong guarantees on the approximation error, (ii) the modified SFA algorithm is best suited for LSPI in both discrete and continuous state spaces and (iii) approximation spaces encoding diffusion distances facilitate LSPI performance.",
