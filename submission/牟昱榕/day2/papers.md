Title: GAVEL: Generating Games Via Evolution and Language Models Authors: Graham Todd, Alexander Padula, Matthew Stephenson, Ã‰ric Piette, Dennis J. N. J. Soemers, Julian Togelius Abstract: Automatically generating novel and interesting games is a complex task. Challenges include representing game rules in a computationally workable form, searching through the large space of potential games under most such representations, and accurately evaluating the originality and quality of previously unseen games. Prior work in automated game generation has largely focused on relatively restricted rule representations and relied on domain-specific heuristics. In this work, we explore the generation of novel games in the comparatively expansive Ludii game description language, which encodes the rules of over 1000 board games in a variety of styles and modes of play. We draw inspiration from recent advances in large language models and evolutionary computation in order to train a model that intelligently mutates and recombines games and mechanics expressed as code. We demonstrate both quantitatively and qualitatively that our approach is capable of generating new and interesting games, including in regions of the potential rules space not covered by existing games in the Ludii dataset. A sample of the generated games are available to play online through the Ludii portal. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09388v2

Title: ScriptDoctor: Automatic Generation of PuzzleScript Games via Large Language Models and Tree Search
Abstract: This paper introduces ScriptDoctor, an LLM-driven system for automatically generating and testing games in PuzzleScript. It uses an iterative loop of generating and testing game design ideas, with human-authored examples grounding the system's output.

Title: Grammar and Gameplay-aligned RL for Game Description Generation with LLMs
Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based method for fine-tuning LLMs for Game Description Generation (GDG). The method uses both grammar and concept rewards to improve the grammatical correctness and fidelity of the generated game descriptions.

Title: Environment Descriptions for Usability and Generalisation in Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: This position paper argues for a shift in RL research towards methodologies where environments are described in user-friendly domain-specific or natural languages to improve usability and generalization.

Title: Anytime Sequential Halving in Monte-Carlo Tree Search
Abstract: This paper proposes an anytime version of the Sequential Halving algorithm for use as a selection strategy in the root node of Monte-Carlo Tree Search, which is designed to approximate the behavior of Sequential Halving without requiring a predetermined budget of iterations.

Title: Exploring RL-based LLM Training for Formal Language Tasks with Programmed Rewards
Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for direct reinforcement learning from explicitly programmed reward signals for tasks expressed through formal languages, such as mathematics and programming.

Title: Open Role-Playing with Delta-Engines
Abstract: This paper proposes a new style of gameplay called open role-playing games (ORPGs), where players can craft and embody their unique characters. It introduces the Delta-Engine, which uses an LLM to realize character growth by generating new code snippets on the base engine incrementally.
ArXiv: 2408.05842
Title: Grammar-based Game Description Generation using Large Language Models
Abstract: This paper presents a framework that leverages LLMs to generate grammatically accurate game descriptions from natural language. The approach consists of two stages: generating a minimal grammar based on GDL specifications and iteratively improving the game description through grammar-guided generation.

Title: Large Language Models and Games: A Survey and Roadmap
Abstract: This paper surveys the current state of the art across the various applications of LLMs in and for games, and identifies the different roles LLMs can take within a game.

Title: From Text to Text Game: A Novel RAG Approach to Gamifying Anthropological Literature and Build Thick Games
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach to gamifying anthropological literature using LLMs, specifically GPT-3.5, to create text-based games. The method employs Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to transform anthropological classics into interactive games.
