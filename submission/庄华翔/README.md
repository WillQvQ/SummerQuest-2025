Hi, I'm 庄华翔 (HuaXiang Zhuang) 👋
I'm currently working on large speech models (SpeechLLM) and passionate about the intersection of AI and audio processing.

Right now, I'm actively reproducing state-of-the-art research papers , exploring potential ideas, and working towards publishing my own findings. If you're also interested in speech recognition, speech generation, or multimodal speech models , feel free to reach out — I'd love to connect, exchange ideas, and possibly collaborate!
